# Malware Analyzer


## Project Description
This group project was made during our Senior Projects class and involved multiple contributors. The web application, made with the **Dash framework**, lets a user uploads a file and 
scans the file to see if it's a virus. The application first disassembles the file using the Linux objdump command, and stores the contents of the disassembled file
in a directory called outputFiles as a .txt file to be scanned. Then, the application scans through the .txt file applying weights derived from training a machine-learning model
that decides whether the uploaded file matches a known virus pattern or not. The outcome of the scan along with a datatable component is outputted to the user. The datatable shows the 
values stored within the .txt file.


## How to run the web application
1. The first option is to visit the [deployed web application](https://monkfish-app-kexeq.ondigitalocean.app).
    - This is the easiest option.

2. The second option involves installing the application onto a local machine.
    - First, download the repository into a folder onto your device.
    - Then, navigate to folder using the terminal/console where the repository was saved to and install the dependencies within the requirements.txt file.
      - To install dependencies, enter $ pip install -r requirements.txt using the terminal/command prompt.

    - Run the program either via the terminal/command prompt by typing **python3 app.py** or by running the program within your preferred IDE that supports Python. 
    - The program will run within the local machine's web browser via http://127.0.0.1:5000/


## How to  use the project
1. Open the application in your chosen web browser.
2. Click on the upload component, navigate to the file using the file browserto scan, and upload the file (file must be an .exe or .dll).
3. Press the objdump button to disassemble the file.
4. Select the Disassembled Files option from the first drop-down list.
5. Select the file to scan using the second drop-down list.
6. When the scan is done, the datatable and results of the scan will be displayed.
